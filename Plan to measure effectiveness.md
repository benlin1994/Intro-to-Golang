# Plan to measure effectiveness

## Success metrics

The following metrics will be monitored to measure the effectiveness of the Golang onboarding course:

* Average number of Golang tasks finished after 2 months 
* Average manager evaluation scores after 2 months 
* Average peer feedback scores after 2 months 
* Number of employees who take another introduction Golang course after taking the Golang onboarding course
* Average time spent reading Golang topics on Stack Overflow
* Average number of times employees have to ask a coworker a question about Golang
* Average time spent writing productive Golang code
* Average number of times employee got asked for help on Golang topics

These metrics of employees who took the Golang onboarding course will be compared against employees who opted-out of the Golang training. We will also compare the metrics with historical data from before the Golang course was created. 


## Course surveys

Course surveys will also be conducted to gather feedback on the effectiveness of the Golang course. Course survey results will be compared whenever there is a new iteration of the Golang course to see if the course has improved. The course surveys will measure the following metrics:

* Course satisifaction
* Exercise satisfaction
* Knowledge Check satisfaction
* Average time to complete the course
* Course completion percentage
* Self evaluation of Golang expertise level
* Knowledge Check percentage correct
* Exercise attempt percentage
