# Course abstract

## Course summary

This course is intended to quickly onboard engineers to be productive in Golang. Students will learn how to set up a Golang project on their machine, as well as the basic syntax and control flow of the language. Further along, students will dive deeper into the more advanced data structures that Golang has to offer. 

This course assumes that students are already familiar with another programming languages and doesn't re-explain basic programming concepts. Instead, the course uses many code examples to highlight how Golang differs from other languages. There are also knowledge checks and coding exercises to give students hands on activities to run actual code. Students should be able to finish the entire course including the exercises in about 3 hours. 

## Target audience

The target audience for this course is new engineers at Uber going through onboarding training. These engineers already are experts in another programming language such as C or Java and don't need to be retaught basic programming concepts. These engineers are at the top of their field and learn new concepts quickly. 

## Course delivery

This course will be delivered online through GitHub. Since this course involves coding, the engineers will naturally be at their computers and should be able to consume this course online. Github also allows the students to easily access the coding exercises.
