# Module 1 Exercise


## Instructions

Download the Module 1 exercise file named `exercise1.go`. The file contains a main function with a few tests. Your exercise is to implement all of the following functions so they pass all of the tests:

* radiusToCirc - takes in one float64 to represent a radius length and returns the circumference of a circle with the specified radius length. Use a constant for Pi and have it equal 3.14 and assume positive radii.

* isShorter - takes in one string and one integer and returns a true if the string length is shorter or equal to the integer. Use the `len(string)` method to calculate the length.

* swap - takes in two integers and returns the two integers in swapped order. Use named return values.

## Test your results

Test your results by running `exercise1.go` with the `go run exercise1.go` command. If your functions output the same as the results shown below, you have passed all of the test cases:

```
